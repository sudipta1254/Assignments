Database is an organized collection of related data that can be stored, accessed & manipulated by a computer system.

DBMS is a management system(computer software program) which is a intermidiate entity between database files & the user with the help of which user can store &manipulate data.

SQL is a structured query language which facilitates the funtionality of database operations through DBMS.

MySQL:-
DDL - Data Defination Language
DML - Data Manipulation Language
DCL - Data Control Language

Types of databases:-
1. Relational Database - MySQL - Type of database that stores & provides access to data points that are related to one another using tables, rows & columns.
    Based on relational model with keys & foreign keys & straight forward way of representing data in tables.
    These uses SQL to perform queries & maintain data.
    Oldest & most widely used database.
    Featues:-
        a. ACID property - The database maintains integrity(correctness) while performing transactions & ensuring that the data is atomic, consistent, isolated & durable.
        b. Range of datatypes - Database can store any data & carry out complex queries such as arithmetic, logical, string & date operations.
        c. Collaborative - The database supports multiple users & concurrent access allow them to work on the same project.
        d. Secure - The database limits or restricts access to the data through user permission & encryption.
        e. Stable - Well understood & documented & have many tools & frameworks available develepment & maintainance.
    Examples:- Online transactions, IoT, data warehouses, small scale websites.

2. Non-relational Database - PostGRE - Type of database that doesn't follow relational model & doesn't use tables to store data.
    These are more flexible & scalable than relational database.
    It can handle large volumes of unstructured & semi-structured data.
    Used in data warehouse.
    These use various data models such as document, key-value, graph & column.

3. Object-oriented Database - MongoDB - A type of database that stores & manipulates data as objects instead of tables, rows & columns.
    Based on object oriented paradigm(concept/principle) which allows data to have attributes & behaviour.
    Can handle complex datatypes such as multimedia, graphics & spatial data.
