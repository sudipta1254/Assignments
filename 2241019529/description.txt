The given code defines four classes to represent employees and their details, and provides several methods to query the employee data. 

The 'Date' class represents a date with day, month, and year fields. The 'Address' class extends 'Date' and adds fields for address,
country, and pin. The 'Employee' class extends 'Address' and adds fields for name, job position, contact number, employee ID, and salary.
It also includes a 'getDetails()' method to print the employee details.

The 'Test' class includes the 'main' method to test the other methods. It creates an array of 'Employee' objects and populates it
with data from the user. Then it calls the following methods:

- 'arrangeEmployeeBySalary': Sorts the employees in the array by salary in descending order.
- 'getEmployeeByJobPosition': Prints the details of employees with a given job position.
- 'getEmployeeByHireDate': Prints the details of employees hired between two given dates.
- 'foreignEmployeeCount': Counts the number of employees with a contact number that does not start with "91".
- 'getEmployeeBySalary': Prints the details of employees with a salary between two given amounts.
