The given code defines four classes, Date, Address, Employee, and Test.
The Date class has three fields, day, month, and year, and a constructor that initializes these fields.
The Address class extends the Date class and has three fields, address, country, and pin,
and a constructor that initializes these fields and the fields inherited from the Date class.
The Employee class extends the Address class and has five fields, name, jobPosition, contactNumber,
empId, and salary, and a constructor that initializes these fields and the fields inherited from the Address class.
It also has a method getDetails() that prints the details of an employee. The Test class has five static methods,
arrangeEmployeeBySalary(), getEmployeeByJobPosition(), getEmployeeByHireDate(), foreignEmployeeCount(), and getEmployeeBySalary(),
which sort employees by salary, find employees by job position, hire date, count foreign employees, and find employees
within a salary range, respectively. In the main method, it creates an array of two employees, initializes them with some values,
and then calls the static methods of the Test class to perform various operations on the employees.
