The code represents a program that manages the employee database for a company. It defines three classes: 'Date', 'Address', and 'Employee'.
'Date' class represents the date object and contains three instance variables: 'day', 'month', and 'year'. The 'Address' class is derived
from the 'Date' class and contains additional instance variables: 'address', 'country', and 'pin'. The 'Employee' class is derived from
the 'Address' class and contains additional instance variables: 'name', 'jobPosition', 'contactNumber', 'empId', and 'salary'.
It also defines several methods to manage the employee database.

The 'main()' method creates an array of 500 'Employee' objects, gets input from the user to initialize the objects, and then
performs several operations on the objects.

The 'arrangeEmployeeBySalary()' method sorts the employees in descending order by salary.

The 'getEmployeeByJobPosition()' method displays the details of employees whose job position is "Manager".

The 'getEmployeeByHireDate()' method displays details of employees whose hire date is in between 01-04-2022 to 31-03-2023.

The 'foreignEmployeeCount()' method displays the number of foreign employees.
